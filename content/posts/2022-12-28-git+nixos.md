# Git + NixOS = <3

Setting up servers can be bothersome and maintaining and installing new software
can be a huge timesink. In this post I will go through how I combined gitolite
with nixos to make it easier to maintain and transfer servers. _easier in my
opinion_. This method allows someone to manage this with a simple git repository
containing the Nix configuration file, when pushed it should automatically
update and apply the new configuration to the server.

* [NixOS](https://nixos.org) is a linux distribution that supports a declarative
  style of configuration.
* [Gitolite](https://gitolite.com) allows you to setup git hosting with
  fine-grained access control over git repositories.

You do not need to setup gitolite on all maintained servers, but automating the
process this way requires gitolite installed somewhere.


## Setup

First off, you need a server with a fresh installation of NixOS available.
