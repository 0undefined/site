# About me

I am a MSc. Computer science student, DIY handyman, and _quite_ a beer
enthusiast. I love GNU/Linux and open software. Taking apart computers and other
electronic devices has always been a fascination to me (and the reassembly,
ofc.).

## About the site

This is a static site hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), from which I can edit it in
a local repository and push the changes/blog posts/etc.  whenever I see fit. I
use cloudflare for the `domain->gh` stuff, and you can follow the tutorial
[here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/) if you want to.

The theme is my own fork of [jekyll console theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console) which contains minor changes to
better fit my taste.
