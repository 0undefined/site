# About me

Spent 7 years getting my Cand. Scient. Computer Science degree -- if I can do
it, so can you!

I enjoy beer, climbing, and handy-work. Love building custom mechanical keyboards!



## About the site

The site is build using [zola](https://www.getzola.org) and hosted somewhere in
the cloud. The theme is based on my fork of the
[jekyll console theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console), with
some minor tweaks to make the theme more markdown-like. The theme has later been
modified further, and adapted to changes in my preferences.


This site used to be hosted as a static site on
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/) following
[this](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)
tutorial. I wasn't aware that you could use Zola to generate github pages at the
time though, but moving the site was somewhat a natural consequence of the fact
that I wanted to host my personal email on the same domain.
