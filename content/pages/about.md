# About me

I am a MSc. Computer science student, DIY handyman, and _quite_ a beer
enthusiast. I love GNU/Linux and open software. Taking apart computers and other
electronic devices has always been a fascination to me (and the reassembly,
ofc.).

## About the site

The site is build using [zola](https://www.getzola.org) and hosted somewhere in
the cloud. The theme is based on my fork of the
[jekyll console theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console), with
some minor tweaks to make the theme more markdown-like.


This site used to be hosted as a static site on
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/) following
[this](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)
tutorial.
