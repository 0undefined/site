# Site source

This is the source for my personal site. The template and style is largely
based off my [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/0undefined/jekyll-theme-console),
which is just a customized fork of
[jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console).

I use zola as the static page generator, works pretty good ngl.
